# Passive to Active Learning System

## Project Title
Passive to Active Learning Transformation System

## Project Folder
Active_to_passive_learning-main  
(Passive → Active Learning Implementation)

## Objective
The objective of this project is to convert passive learning methods into active learning experiences using interactive simulations, visualizations, and computational models. The system aims to improve conceptual understanding by enabling users to actively engage with learning content rather than consuming it passively.

## Description
This project focuses on transforming traditional passive learning (reading, observing) into active learning by using Python-based simulations, physics models, visual tools, and interactive components. It includes multiple modules that demonstrate scientific, mathematical, and conceptual ideas through computation, visualization, and user interaction.

The project integrates physics simulations, 3D modeling scripts, UI components, and web-based interfaces to encourage experimentation, exploration, and hands-on learning.
